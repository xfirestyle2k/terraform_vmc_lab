# Documentation

First of all, all my test ran at a lab platformâ€¦ Use following code at your own risk, I won't be responsible for any issues you may run into. Thanks!

In this repository I created a automated distributed Firewall Ruleset for a Horizon Environment, which can be used with
Terraform on VMware Cloud or local installed NSX-T.

It only apply Horizon related Services, groups and Distributed Firewall Sections and Rules.

This code should support you to build a secured and least privilege Horizon Plattform or get a idea how you can secure your Horizon Environment.

To get familiar with VMC and VMC NSX-T I highly recommend to take a look on the Blog posts from Nicolas Vibert:

I will keep on working on this script and add new services, rules and groups.
